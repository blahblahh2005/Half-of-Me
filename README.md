## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

## Inspiration💡:

Unfinished ideas like poems, letters, code, art, often die in drafts because we fear judgment, lack inspiration, or don’t know how to finish. Mental health struggles amplify this. What if you could share half of something and let the world (or AI) help complete it, on your own terms?

## What it does🤷‍♀️:

Half of Me is a mood-driven creative sanctuary where:

**->**You write the first half; AI or a collaborator finishes it, guided by your emotional direction.
**->**The UI adapts to your mood (confused → calm → excited).
**->**Flip through entries like a diary, revisit old ideas, or send them to your future self.

## What technologies are used for this project?

Frontend: JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Vite, Shadcn-UI

Backend: Express (Node.js) for the server, CORS for cross-origin access, dotenv for environment variables, OpenAI SDK to call GPT-4, and TypeScript with ts-node-dev for typed, auto-reloading backend development.
